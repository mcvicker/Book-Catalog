# importer.py imports books from a Shelfari TSV file.                        #
# based on the book's title, it finds each book  using google books API      #
# and finds an appropriate image and description for each book.              #
# It imports the fields from the TSV and the API into the bookcatalog.db     #
# Note that you can't run this importer indefinitely, google has             #
# daily data caps.                                                           #
