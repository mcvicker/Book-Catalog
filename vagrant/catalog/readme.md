To take a look at the project, run "bash setup.sh" from the directory you are currently in.
Note that setup can take a long time as the database has to be instantiated and nearly 1000 entries 
must be imported. 

This is a rough version of the project but I am requesting feedback now. I apologize in advance for the
scanty documentation.
